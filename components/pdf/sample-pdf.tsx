### **3. Final Suggestions**
- **Consistent Layout:** Make sure all sections are well-aligned, and don't forget about small visual cues like dividers, icons (like email icons), or subtle separators between fields.
- **White Space:** Try adding a bit more padding in the preview section to give each section room to breathe.
- **Color Ideas:** If you want to make your design more engaging, consider using **section headers in light blue** and keeping text dark for better readability.
